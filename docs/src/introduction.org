** Version 0.3.7+1

P2G makes it simple to ensure that parts are in fixtures
correctly, coordinate systems are adjusted to deal with stock
placement and cope with movement and rotation of workpieces through
multiple operations.

P2G is a compiler; it takes Python code, some definitions of machine
specific variables, a little glue and makes G-code, so far, Haas
ideomatic.

Thanks to magic it can do surprising things with python data
structures, anything reasonably calculated statically during
compilation can be used in the source, classes, dicts, and so on.

It comes with a set of macro variable definitions for a Haas mill with
NCD.  And a few example settings for my own VF-3SSYT.
